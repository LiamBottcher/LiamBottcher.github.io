# WELCOME
This is my personal portfolio!

I am always working on a side project for school my current one is a java swing tower defense game where I make my own sprites and learn how the logic works. I am following a tutorial for that and it is currently a work in progress as well.

As for the porfolio, it highlights all my accopmlishments more in depth than my resume, as well as also giving me good practice to show off my html and css skills
